Implementation is easy


1. Open the macOS Automator app, by going into Applications, or by pressing  
  command + Spacebar, and searching for it.
2. Create a **new Quick Action**
3. In the list of Actions on the left, choose **"Run AppleScript"**
4. Copy+Paste the code from any of the workflow files, in place of all the purple code
5. Press the **"Hammer" logo** to make sure there are no compilation errors (there should not be any)
> Note: Some files have customization instructions as comments, do read through them
6. Save this file

Now, a method of activation may be added as per personal choice (for example, keyboard shortcut through **System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services**

Since I have MacBook with a touchpad, I like to go to **System Preferences > Keyboard**, and in the dropdown menu for **"Press Fn key to"**, choose **"Show Quick Actions"**. Now, at any time, if you press the fn key, your touchbar will show this-
